# Solar System Generator
Procedurally generate different solar systems with different stars and planets.

This is a small fun project that I've used to help learn the basics about 3D rendering and modeling and might be of interest to others looking to do the same.

## Run
Run the following commands: `npm install` then `npm run dev`

## Features
- ☀️ STARS
    - Different star types eg: Giants, Main Sequence and Dwarf Stars
    - Stars vary in size and color depending on star type
- 🪐 PLANETS     
    - Different planet types eg: Gas Giants, Rocky Worlds, Icy Worlds, Hell Worlds
    - Atmospheres...
